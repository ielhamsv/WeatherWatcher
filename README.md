# WeatherWatcher
WeatherWatcher is a project developed to enhance my skills in asynchronous JavaScript. This application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. It allows users to search for weather information by city, providing details such as temperature and weather conditions
